This R script was used to generate the Figure 5 of the BSc thesis.
In the work this study is justified:
"Our group found that 31.6% of the genes of K. nitens annotation had no expression. As this finding is one of the premises that motivate us to focus on H3K27me3 haracterization, it is relevant to assess whether this low genome expression is consistent with the other two RNA-seq studies"
